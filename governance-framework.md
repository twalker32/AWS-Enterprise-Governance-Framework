# Governance Framework Design – Scenario 1

## 📘 Objective

Design a scalable, secure AWS governance framework that enables Toyota’s cloud teams to move quickly without compromising compliance, visibility, or control.

---

## 🧱 1. Deploy AWS Control Tower to Standardize Accounts

- Set up standardized landing zones across OUs like Manufacturing, R&D, and Consumer Services.
- Automate account vending using pre-approved blueprints.
- Enforce guardrails like:
  - Mandatory CloudTrail
  - Encryption by default
  - Disabling public S3 buckets

---

## 🛡️ 2. Apply Service Control Policies via AWS Organizations

- Use SCPs to enforce preventive controls:
  - Deny access to unapproved regions
  - Enforce encryption for S3 and EBS
  - Block IAM privilege escalation
- Delegate SCP control to trusted admins while securing root access

---

## 👁️ 3. Centralize Detection with Security Hub

- Enable Security Hub using delegated admin across accounts
- Aggregate findings from:
  - GuardDuty
  - Inspector
  - IAM Access Analyzer
  - AWS Config

---

## 📐 4. Enforce Compliance with AWS Config Conformance Packs

- Deploy Conformance Packs aligned with:
  - NIST 800-53
  - CIS Benchmarks
  - ISO 27001
- Identify compliance drift and misconfigurations at scale

---

## 🔬 5. Layer in Orca Security for Contextual Visibility

- Use Orca to provide:
  - Agentless scanning
  - Risk context (e.g., exposed S3 with sensitive data + privilege path)
  - Executive dashboards for reporting

---

## 🔁 6. Automate Remediation with Config + EventBridge

- Use AWS Config Remediation Rules + SSM Automation Docs:
  - Auto-remove public access to S3
  - Auto-tag missing resources
- Route findings to the SOC using EventBridge + SNS (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty)

---

## 🤝 7. Empower Teams with IAM Identity Center + Templates

- Enable SSO via IAM Identity Center (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- Provide Terraform or CloudFormation templates through Service Catalog or GitHub
- Use tagging policies + budget alarms for team autonomy with guardrails

---

## 🔄 8. Review & Refine with Governance Feedback Loops

- Conduct quarterly reviews using Security Hub and Orca reports
- Adjust policies and access based on real-world feedback from builders

---

## ✅ Closing Statement

This framework balances security, automation, and innovation—ensuring Toyota's cloud foundation is scalable, compliant, and trusted by both engineering and leadership.
