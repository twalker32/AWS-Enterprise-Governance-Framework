# Compliance Implementation Guide

This guide outlines how AWS Config Conformance Packs are used to maintain continuous compliance across AWS accounts, aligning with industry-standard frameworks like CIS and NIST.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Conformance Packs Included

### 1. `cis-aws-foundations-pack.yaml`
Implements key controls from the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.2. Includes rules such as:
- Block public S3 buckets
- Enable MFA on root account
- Enable CloudTrail across regions

### 2. `nist-800-53-high-pack.yaml`
Implements technical controls aligned with NIST 800-53 High baseline. Includes rules such as:
- Enforce CloudTrail logging
- Secure IAM password policy
- Monitor root account activity

---

## ðŸ§  How to Use

Deploy these YAML packs via AWS Config using either:
- AWS Console > Conformance Packs > Deploy New Pack
- AWS CLI or CloudFormation Stack

We recommend attaching conformance packs to **organizational units (OUs)** to enforce consistency across dev, test, and prod environments.

## âœ… Outcome

With conformance packs in place, your organization gains a continuously enforced and auditable compliance layer â€” reducing drift and aligning with security best practices.
