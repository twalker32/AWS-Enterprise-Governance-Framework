# 🧠 Compliance Overview for Beginners

Welcome! This guide is designed for anyone new to AWS Config, compliance frameworks, or cloud governance. Whether you're a student, early-career engineer, or just diving into AWS security, this file will help you understand the *why* and *how* behind compliance automation in AWS.

---

## 🧰 What is AWS Config?

**AWS Config** is a service that continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and evaluates them against desired baselines. Think of it like a security camera that checks your cloud for misconfigurations.

You can use AWS Config to:
- Detect public S3 buckets
- Track untagged resources
- Ensure encryption is enabled

## 📦 What are Conformance Packs?

Conformance Packs are pre-built collections of **AWS Config rules** based on industry standards. They're like plug-and-play templates for compliance. AWS offers packs aligned to:

- [NIST 800-53 Rev. 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf)
- [CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark](https://learn.cisecurity.org/benchmarks)
- PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and more.

Each pack helps validate that your AWS environment meets security requirements.

## 🔐 Why NIST and CIS?

### 🏛️ **NIST 800-53**
Developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology**, this framework outlines security and privacy controls for federal systems — and it's widely adopted in the private sector too.  
**Use case:** Healthcare, government, education, or high-regulation industries.

More info: [NIST 800-53 Controls](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)

---

### 🧰 **CIS AWS Benchmark**
Created by the **Center for Internet Security**, this benchmark is a practical, actionable checklist of AWS best practices.
**Use case:** Any organization seeking security hygiene or preparing for audits.

## ⚙️ How Does This Work?

1. You deploy the conformance pack YAML file into your AWS account.
2. AWS Config evaluates your resources against the rules.
3. You get a compliance dashboard showing what’s passing or failing.
4. Optional: automate remediation using SSM or Lambda (covered in our [Remediation Guide](../remediation-automation/remediation-automation-guide.md)).

## 🧩 Who Should Use This?

✅ New security engineers  
✅ Cloud architects documenting enterprise compliance  
✅ Students prepping for AWS certs  
✅ Auditors and GRC analysts reviewing cloud standards

## ✅ Summary

Compliance isn’t about checkboxes — it’s about trust, visibility, and keeping innovation safe. These conformance packs help build that trust while reducing manual work.
