# SCP Examples

This folder contains foundational Service Control Policies (SCPs) used to enforce preventive security controls across AWS Organizations.

## Included Policies

- `deny-unapproved-regions.json`  
  Blocks all regions except those explicitly allowed (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2).

- `enforce-s3-encryption.json`  
  Denies `s3:PutObject` calls unless server-side encryption (SSE) is specified.

- `deny-iam-escalation.json`  
  Prevents identity-based privilege escalation by restricting IAM policy manipulation actions.

## Purpose

These SCPs are part of a layered governance model designed to reduce misconfigurations and enforce least privilege at scale.
