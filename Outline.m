# AWS Enterprise Governance Framework

This project outlines a secure, scalable, and innovation-friendly governance model designed for large AWS environments like Toyotaâ€™s. It integrates AWS native tools (Control Tower, Security Hub, SCPs) with third-party context providers like Orca Security to enforce preventive controls, ensure visibility, and automate remediation at scale.
