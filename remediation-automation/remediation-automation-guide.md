# Remediation Automation Guide

This guide outlines how AWS Config, Lambda, and Systems Manager (SSM) are combined to create auto-remediation workflows for common security misconfigurations in an enterprise AWS environment.

## ðŸš¨ Why It Matters

Detection is only half the battle. Without automation, security findings pile up with no action. This automation layer ensures high-risk misconfigurations are remediated in real-time or escalated immediately to the Security Operations Center (SOC).

---

## ðŸ§° Key Components

### âœ… AWS Config Rules
Evaluate resources for compliance (e.g., public S3, missing tags). Config can trigger remediation workflows when rules are non-compliant.

### âœ… SSM Automation Documents (Runbooks)
Define pre-approved workflows to fix common issues like:
- Removing public S3 access
- Enabling encryption
- Tagging untagged resources

### âœ… AWS Lambda + EventBridge
EventBridge triggers Lambda functions to:
- Run SSM automation documents
- Send notifications via SNS to SOC
- Integrate with Slack, PagerDuty, or SIEM

---

## ðŸ“¦ Sample Remediations

### `auto-remove-public-s3.yaml`
Detects and remediates public access to S3 buckets automatically using a predefined SSM document.

### `tag-missing-resources.yaml`
Detects untagged EC2 instances or volumes and applies default tags based on business unit or owner.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Deployment Notes

- Attach remediation rules to AWS Config at the org or OU level
- Use IAM roles with least privilege to execute automation documents
- Ensure tagging is consistent to route alerts by environment or team

---

## âœ… Outcome

With remediation automation in place, AWS environments are no longer passiveâ€”they actively defend themselves against misconfigurations and reduce Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) for security findings.
